Comparison of the Inflation During Trump’s and Biden’s Terms: A Case Study on Egg Price Changes
Final Project of SURV/SURVMETH 727 - Fundamental of Data Display and Computing
Work by Lingchen Meng
Background
Inflation, the rise in general price level of goods and services, which influenced by various factors, such as international supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions. Especially after covid-19 pandemic, inflation is out of manipulation in most countries so as the US, and it initially become a focus of the 2024 presidential election debate. 
Egg prices, which is one of the most common foods on American’s table, and egg prices are a clear and relatable indicator of inflation because it can directly relate to supply and demand dynamics which makes eggs a microcosm of broader inflation trends. Trump’s term (2017–2021) was marked by relatively stable inflation before the pandemic caused disruptions, while Biden’s term (2021–2024) has been characterized by ongoing pandemic aftershocks and efforts to stabilize the economy.

Question of Interest
This study uses egg prices to illustrate how inflation has evolved during these two administrations, providing insights into the economic challenges faced by consumers and policymakers alike. 
1) How did egg prices fluctuate during Trump’s and Biden’s terms, and what factors contributed to these changes?
(2) How did external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and avian flu outbreaks, impact egg prices over time?
(3) What insights can the price trends of a staple commodity like eggs provide about broader inflationary pressures and economic policies under the two administrations?
Methodology
Data Source
I gathered monthly egg price data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) using its API, spanning from January 2017 to October 2024. Egg prices were selected because of their sensitivity to inflationary pressures and their significance as a staple consumer good. The dataset encompasses price fluctuations influenced by external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and avian flu outbreaks. By utilizing official government data, I guarantee the accuracy and reliability of tracking price trends over the two presidential terms.
Analysis Techniques
The analysis employs interactive visualizations created using Shiny to explore egg price trends over time. Time series analysis is used to identify significant fluctuations and patterns, while key economic events and policies are overlaid for context. Additionally, comparisons between the Trump and Biden administrations are made to highlight the effects of external shocks and economic policies on price stability. The visualizations include line charts with adjustable filters for date ranges and price levels, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data.
